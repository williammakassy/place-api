Hello there, this is manage-place api
Here are the steps to following so as you can be able to run this api crud application,

<p>1. First you have install a web server, where I for one I have use Xampp web server,</p>
<br>
<p>2. After you have completed the installation of a web server, you will create a folder and name it place-api,</p>
<br>
<p>3. Then you will download the project from github and paste all the folders and files to the place-api folder,</p>
<p>4. After that you will run xampp web server where you are required to start Apache and MySQL,</p>
<br>
<p>5. And there you will open any web browser and type 'localhost' to the URL and then you will navigate to phpMyAdmin</p>
<br>
<p>6. There you will create a database, name it db_manageplaces and after that you are supposed to insert the database sql file from the place-api folder</p>
<br>
<p>7. the sql file name is db_manageplaces.sql,</p>
<br>
<p>8. after that you will open the project to any text editor, but I suggest to use visual studio code text editor in order to be able to run the project.</p>
<br>
<p>9. And then to test the API you will use Postman app, So you have to download and install postman for testing activities.</p>
<br>
<p>10. When you're done with installing Postman, you'll create a new workspace where you have to test all the operations there.</p>
<p>11. For testing urls you have to use the below urls:</p>
<br>
<p>12. http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/places - Here you will be able to see all the places. Note: You will select GET method</p>
<br>
<p>13. http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/places/1 - Here you will be able to see one record by writing id on the url. Note: You will select GET METHOD</p>
<br>
<p>14. http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/updatePlace/1 - Here you will be able to edit, and you have to select PUT method.</p>
<br>
<p>15. http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/places - Here you have to select POST method so as to store data to the database</p>
<br>
<p>16. http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/places/1 - Here you will delete the record but to do so you have to select DELETE METHOD</p>
